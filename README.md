# Autohotkey scripts

I use the index scripts to automatically open programs or focus their windows if they're already open. I use the concept from [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/) to map one key on my keyboard to CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + WIN, and then I press the key associated with that program. For example, to open VS Code, I press my Hyperkey button + C. For Notion, it's Hyperkey + N, etc.

This git dir is stored at `C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\autohotkey-scripts`, with the .ahk files in the parent directory, so that they run at startup. I use the .ps1 script in this repo to copy them from the parent dir into the repo so that they are version controlled with git.
